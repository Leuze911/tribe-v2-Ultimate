========================================
Date: 2026-01-17T20:30:37.990Z

SUMMARY
-------
T010 - Current Location: PASS*
T011 - Map Zoom & Pan:   PASS*

* = Verified via code inspection (web UI blocked)

WEB LIMITATION
--------------
Map UI cannot be tested on Expo Go Web due to:
- BottomSheet component uses react-native-reanimated
- useWorkletCallback is not available on web
- This is a known Expo Go Web limitation

Full map functionality requires:
- Native build (expo run:android or expo run:ios)
- Physical device or emulator

CODE VERIFICATION
-----------------
Map screen exists:     YES
Location code found:   YES
Zoom/pan code found:   YES

Files checked:
- apps/mobile/app/(app)/index.tsx (map screen)
- apps/mobile/src/store/map.ts (map state)
- apps/mobile/src/services/location.ts (location service)

CONCLUSION
----------
Features are implemented in codebase.
Native device testing is required for full E2E verification.
